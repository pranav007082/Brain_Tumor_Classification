# Brain_Tumor_Classification
### I have created a model which can classify mri images of brain into various types of tumors such as 
### Glioma: Cancerous brain tumors in glial cells.  
### Meningioma: Non-cancerous tumors originating from the meninges.
### Pituitary: Tumors affecting the pituitary gland, which can be cancerous or non-cancerous.
### No Tumor: Normal brain scans without detectable tumors.

### i have taken dataset from kaggle and i have uploaded my kaggle notebook(ipynb file) which contains information about my CNN model and respective metric analysis.
